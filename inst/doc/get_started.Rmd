# Set up a connection to the Species+ database

## Get your personal token
To set up a connection to the CITES Species+ database, an authentication token
is required. Each user should obtain his or her own personal token
to run the code below (see https://api.speciesplus.net/documentation for more details).
To obtain a token, sign up on the [Speciesplus API website](http://api.speciesplus.net/users/sign_up).

## Set the token
Now, we assume that you already have a token. For illustrative purposes,
we will use the generic token value `8QW6Qgh57sBG2k0gtt` for the API
documentation.

A token is mandatory and needs to be passed to the header of all URL
requests. They are three different ways to set the token in `rcites`:

1. set an environment variable `SPECIESPLUS_TOKEN` in
[`.Renviron`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Startup.html)
file (preferred);

2. use `set_token()` to set up the token as character string (with quotes). If not
entered in the function, the token can be passed without quotes (not as character
string) after a prompt. This way, the token `SPECIESPLUS_TOKEN` is interactively
set up for the current R session (meaning a login will be required for the future
R sessions);

```{r, eval = FALSE}
set_token("8QW6Qgh57sBG2k0gtt")
```

3. use the `token` argument of the functions, *i.e.* the token is passed manually
to each function call.


# Use of key features

## Access the Speciesplus taxon concept and retrieve a taxon id

To efficiently query information from the CITES Speciesplus database, you
first need to retrieve the unique taxon identifier `taxon_id` from the [Speciesplus taxon concept](https://api.speciesplus.net/documentation/v1/taxon_concepts/index.html).
To do so, you should first call `spp_taxonconcept()` and provide the scientific
name of the taxon you look for. Let us start by requesting the identifier of the
African bush elephant, *i.e.* *Loxodonta africana*.

```{r}
library(rcites)
res1 <- spp_taxonconcept(query_taxon = "Loxodonta africana")
res1
```

Note regarding the token:
If you chose option 3, then the code will look as follows:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
res1 <- spp_taxonconcept(query_taxon = "Loxodonta africana", token = "8QW6Qgh57sBG2k0gtt")
```

`res1` is a list of data.table object with different information pertaining
to the naming of the taxon. If you however only need first details about
the species" CITES listing, setting `appendix_only` to `TRUE` will return
the first data.table, `all`, for instance.

```{r}
res2 <- spp_taxonconcept(query_taxon = "Loxodonta africana")#, appendix_only = TRUE)
res2
```

For other taxon, there might be more than one identifier, in such a case you
should have a look at the `active` column.

```{r}
res3 <- spp_taxonconcept(query = "Amazilia versicolor")#, appendix_only = TRUE)
res3
```

Also, if the taxon is not listed, a warning message should come up.

```{r}
res4 <- spp_taxonconcept(query = "Homo Sapiens")
```


For what follows we should keep in mind:

|name                | identifier|
|:-------------------|:----------|
|Loxodonta africana  | 4521      |
|Amazilia versicolor | 3210      |


## Access CITES legislation data

```{r}
leg1 <- spp_cites_legislation(taxon_id = "4521")
leg2 <- spp_cites_legislation(taxon_id = "3210")
```


## Access EU legislation data

```{r}
leg3 <- spp_eu_legislation(taxon_id = "4521")
leg4 <- spp_eu_legislation(taxon_id = "3210", scope = "all")
```


##  Access a taxon distribution data

```{r}
distr <- spp_distributions("4521")
```


## Access a listing reference data

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ref <- spp_references(taxon_id = "3210")
length(ref$distribution$reference)
length(ref$taxonomic$citation)
ref$taxonomic$citation
```


## Query more than one species at a time

Currently, there is no direct way to access more than one species at a time.
In order to do so, you should therefore loop over a vector of species or a vector of identifier.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
vc_sp <- c("Amazilia versicolor", "Loxodonta africana")
res <- lapply(vc_sp, function(x) spp_taxonconcept(query_taxon = x)#, appendix_only = TRUE))
do.call(rbind, res)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
vc_id <- c(4521, 3210)
res <- lapply(vc_id,
    function(x) unlist(
      spp_eu_legislation(taxon_id = x)
    )[1:6]
)
```


## Use of the simplify function

The `rcites_simplify()` function can be used for an outcome that is easier to read. It can be either called directly within an access function having the `spp_` prefix, through having `simplify = TRUE` or used afterwards.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
leg2 <- rcites_simplify(leg1)
```
